What Makes It Different
1. Purpose-Built for Junk Removal + Service Trades
Instead of trying to serve 30+ industries, it focuses on:
Junk removal
Hauling
Landscaping
Small handyman
Pressure washing
Cleaning crews
Local service businesses
This lets the CRM customize the experience around real workflows—load pricing, service windows, route planning, dump receipts, equipment tracking, and before-and-after photos.
2. Fast & Simple Quoting
Built for quick lead conversion:
Prebuilt templates for junk removal load tiers
One-tap estimates via text
AI-assisted quote drafting for images customers send
Lead → Quote → Invoice in seconds
No long forms. No complicated settings.
Just fast selling.
3. Clean Calendar & Scheduling
A simple drag-and-drop board:
Daily, weekly, monthly views
Assign jobs to crew
Block travel time
Auto-calculate job duration
Designed so even a new employee can understand it instantly.
4. Instant Customer Communication
Small businesses win when they respond quickly, so the CRM includes:
Built-in texting
Follow-up reminders
Auto-reply for new leads
One-touch “On the way” messages
No need for a separate messaging platform.
5. Smart Money Features
Instead of a full accounting suite, the CRM supports:
Simple invoices
Integrated card payments
Deposit requests
Job cost inputs (dump fee, gas, labor hours)
Profit per job calculation
This gives owners clarity without drowning them in bookkeeping.
6. Tools That Match Real Service Business Needs
Your CRM focuses on features small operators actually use daily:
Job notes for crew
Before/After photo uploads
Signature capture
Quick expense input
Route optimization
Customer tags (repeat, lead source, priority)
Simple → Reliable → Operational.
7. AI-Powered, But Not Overwhelming
AI is used only to make work faster:
Auto-draft estimates from customer photos
Create job descriptions from short notes
Auto-generate follow-up messages
Suggest schedule windows
No big automation builder. No complicated triggers.
Just convenience.
8. Built for Growth & Multi-Crew Work
As businesses grow from 1 to 5 trucks, the CRM grows with them:
Crew app
Job assignment
Payroll export
Role-based access
Still simple, but scalable.
9. Affordable, Honest Pricing
No:
per-feature fees
“pro” add-ons
forced annual plans
Just one simple monthly price that includes everything.
The Mission
To give small service business owners—especially junk removal companies—the tool they’ve always wanted:
Simple, fast, affordable, and built around how the work is actually done.
Not corporate. Not complicated.
Just practical.
